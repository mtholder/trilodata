Prediction to test from BSL:

Initially (before 407.6 million years ago (in the British time scale) or 409.1 million years ago (in the German time scale)) rates of speciation should be quite high and then they decline to zero (see figure 5 Abe & Lieberman).

Extinction rates should kind of be fairly not vary much (see Figure 6 Abe & Lieberman).
